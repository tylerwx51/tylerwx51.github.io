        <h1>Savannah Logan and Tyler White's Data Visualization Project</h1>

        <p>
          Background and Motivation: <br>
          <br>We decided to create data visualizations about comic book characters because we both grew up reading comic books/watching their cartoons. We thought it would be great to know more about the breakdown of characters attributes, gender, number of appearances, etc.. across years and across Marvel and DC. <br>
          <br> Project Objectives: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Compare characters across Marvel and DC comics.</li>
            <li>Compare the attributes given to characters  (appearance, sexuality, etc..) over the years.</li>
            <li>Get an idea of how certain attributes affect a characters popularity (this is judged by the number of appearances they make)</li>
          </ul>

        Our first visualization is a parallel cooridinate plot that helps compare the various attributes of Marvel and DC characters over the years. You can easily brush on the various attributes you want to know more about. Below the graph, a list of characters that fit the current graph's brushings appears. If you want to know more about a particular character on the list, you can hover on their nameand see their information appear on the right side. Or, if you have a character you want to search, you can do so in the search heroes textbox. If you would like to see even more about a character, you can click on their name in the info section and it will lead you to their wikipedia page. Additionally, if you want to filter for only Marvel or DC characters, you are welcome to do so with the buttons on the right side of the graph.<br>

        <br>To see this graph, click on the Project Plot 1 tab.<br>

        <br>Our second visualization allows your to compare the distribution of attributes given to characters over the years. You can look at the attributes within four categories: alignment, sex, gender and sexual minorities, and whether or not they are alive. Feel free to zoom in on specific years of interest by filtering years on the x-axis. If you would like, you can also filter out attributes by clicking on the button next to their name in the legend. This can be useful if you want to see how when particular attributes were popular for new characters. <br>

        <br>To see this graph, click on the Project Plot 2 tab. <br>

        <br>Our third visualization, allows you to see what year minority characters were created and how popular they are based on the number of times they appeared in comics. Whats interesting, is that we can see that there are a lot more homosexual characters that were created then other gender and sexual minorties, but a few bisexual characters are a lot more popular. For example Natalia Romanova is a bisexual character created in the 60s who appeared over a 1000 times. <br>

        <br>To see this graph, click on the Project Plot 3 tab. <br>
